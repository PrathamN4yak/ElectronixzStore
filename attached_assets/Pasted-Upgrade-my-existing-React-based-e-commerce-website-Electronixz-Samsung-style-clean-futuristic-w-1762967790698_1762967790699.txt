Upgrade my existing React-based e-commerce website Electronixz (Samsung-style — clean, futuristic, with blue #1428A0, white, and light gray colors) by adding the following advanced features:

1. Product Rating & Review System

Each product page should allow customers to:

Leave a star rating (1–5 stars).

Write a review/comment.

Display the average rating and a list of reviews below the product details.

Reviews and ratings should be stored locally (use JSON or localStorage).

2. Promo Code & Discount System

On the Cart page, add an input box for customers to enter a promo code.

If the code is valid, apply a discount percentage to the total price dynamically.

Show the discount and final total clearly.

Display a small message like “Promo code applied successfully!” when it’s valid.

3. Admin Panel (Password Protected)

Create an /admin page that requires login with credentials:

Email: admin@electronixz.com

Password: 12345

The admin dashboard should include:

a. Promo Code Management

Create, edit, and delete promo codes.

Set the discount percentage for each code.

List all existing promo codes with their discount values.

b. Sales Analytics

Display total sales, total orders, and best-selling products.

Show data visually using pie, bar, and line charts (use any chart library like Recharts or Chart.js).

Allow viewing sales per product or by category.

c. Review Management

Show all user reviews and ratings from the site.

Allow admin to delete, edit, or hide any review.

Add an option for admin to create fake or new reviews manually (e.g., for showcasing on new products).

4. Design & Layout

Keep the Samsung-style futuristic theme consistent.

Use smooth animations, clean UI, and responsive layouts.

Make the admin dashboard visually distinct but matching the Electronixz brand (use blue & white theme).

Use React components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Keep all existing pages (Home, Products, About, Contact, Cart) intact — just integrate these new features cleanly.
